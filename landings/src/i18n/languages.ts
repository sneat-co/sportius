/**
 * Single source of truth for the locales this landing supports.
 *
 * Thin wrapper over @sneat/astro's createI18n: the locale plumbing (localeHref,
 * routeFromPath, hreflang, og:locale) is shared across the Sneat landings and
 * lives in the package; this module declares THIS landing's locales and
 * re-exports the bound helpers, so every page and component reads unchanged.
 *
 * Routing needs no locale list: the site is assets-only, so a built `/xx/…` page
 * is served as a file and any path without a file gets the app shell. (A missing
 * `/xx/…` page therefore answers 200 with the app shell rather than 404.)
 *
 * Adding a locale, end to end:
 *   1. add it to `langs` below
 *   2. write src/i18n/copy/<code>.ts against the Copy interface
 *   3. register it in src/i18n/copy/index.ts
 *   4. add src/pages/<code>/index.astro and src/pages/<code>/privacy.astro
 * The type-checker will tell you exactly which strings you still owe — that is
 * the main reason Copy is an explicit contract rather than a loose record.
 *
 * Why labels and not flag emoji
 * -----------------------------
 * Flags were considered and rejected across the ecosystem. Don't reintroduce
 * them: flags mark countries not languages (Russian outlives any one flag; no
 * English flag is neutral), Windows renders none of them, and screen readers
 * announce them unpredictably. (Full rationale in @sneat/astro.)
 *
 * A note on fonts: the brand font (Montserrat, see tokens.css) ships Latin and
 * Cyrillic, so this landing needs no per-script font gating. If you swap it for
 * a face that lacks a script you ship — Poppins, for one, has no Cyrillic at
 * all — that locale silently falls back to system-ui and the whole site looks
 * broken in that language only. Check the subsets before you change the font.
